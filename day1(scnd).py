'''Write a Program to Find the Size of int, float, double, and char on Your Computer:
Write a program that displays the size of fundamental data types (int, float, double, and char) on your system. For example:
Output:
Size of int: 4 bytes
Size of float: 4 bytes
Size of double: 8 bytes
Size of char: 1 byte'''

print("Size of double:", struct.calcsize("d"), "bytes")
print("Size of char:", struct.calcsize("c"), "byte")
